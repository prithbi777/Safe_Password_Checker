SUBJECT: Password Checker Tool basically it prevents dictionary attacks. It takes a wordlist which may be used 
in dictionary attacks for cracking files. How it works is suppose you thought a password to encrypt a file but who knows
it might be cracked using dictionary attack so what you can do is before setting the password you can check whether 
the password is already present in the dictionary or not so this is the purpose of this project.
